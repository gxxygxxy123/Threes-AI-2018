To make the sample program
$ make # see makefile for deatils

To run the sample program
$ ./Threes # by default the program will run for 1000 games

To specify the total games to run
$ ./Threes --total=100000

To save the statistic result to a file
$ ./Threes --save=stat.txt # existing file will be overwrited

To load and review the statistic result from a file

To train the network 100000 games, and save the weights to a file
$ ./Threes --total=100000 --block=1000 --play="save=weights.bin"

To load the weights from a file, train the network for 100000 games, and save the weights
$ ./Threes --total=100000 --block=1000 --play="load=weights.bin save=weights.bin"

To set the learning rate of training
$ ./Threes --play="alpha=0.0025"

To load the weights from a file, test the network for 1000 games, and save the statistic
